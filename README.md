# MERN Typescript Blog

> Me practicing MERN stack with Typescript

This is a CRUD blog webapp from the [MERN Typescript BLOG Application](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdSnLYEzOTtqWFNLg7M8iwhOBROHKXWIp) tutorial.

## Objective

- To learn how to write REST API usign Express from scratch.
- To learn authentication using JWT.
- Learn MongoDB.
- Practice Typescript.

## Progress

- This tutorial was outdated. In part 3 of the video, the instructor demonstrated setting up react router from scratch, along with custom Typescript interfaces. But the latest React router uses different implementation with different prop types. Hence I have a few options:

  1. Downgrade react-router to follow the tutorial.
  2. Abandon this project. Find a new and better tutorial.
  3. Find a tutorial of setting up latest react-router and combine it with this tutorial.

  > Still don't know what to do yet. Maybe I'll go with option 2.
